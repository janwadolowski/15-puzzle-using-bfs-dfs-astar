## What is a 15 puzzle?

It's a puzzle where you have a 4 x 4 board of tiles with 15 numbers and 0 (or empty). The goal is to arrange the tiles
in ascending order by swapping the tiles with empty tile (only horizontal and diagonal movements are allowed).

## How is the solution achieved?

We used the following algorithms to solve the puzzle:

* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* A-star (A*)
